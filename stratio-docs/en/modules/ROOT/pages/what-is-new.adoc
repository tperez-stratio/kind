= What's new

The key updates in this version of _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ are:

* Added support for Kubernetes 1.32.
* Updated _cluster-operator_ (v0.5.1), Flux (v2.14.1), and Tigera Operator (v3.29.1).

== Compatibility breakage

Starting with this version, the Docker registry and the Helm repository are set to private by default. You can change this behavior in the cluster’s `ClusterConfig` object by using the `private_registry` and `private_helm_repo` attributes.
