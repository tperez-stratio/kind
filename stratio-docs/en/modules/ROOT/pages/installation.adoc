= Installation

== Prerequisites

=== AWS (EKS and unmanaged)

* Roles and policies
+
For automated provisioning in AWS/EKS, it is necessary to execute actions on various AWS services such as EC2, ECR, EKS, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), etc. While the use or lack of use of these actions will depend on the type of installation, the provider validates that the indicated user has these permissions in order to run normally.
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-eks-policy.json[Download permanent permissions for EKS].
** xref:attachment$stratio-aws-temp-policy.json[Download temporary permissions for EKS].

+
For EKS deployment, you must manually create the "AWSServiceRoleForAmazonEKS" role and associate to it the "AmazonEKSServiceRolePolicy" policy (created by default in AWS).

* Certified operating systems
+
To ensure the functionalities supported by the EKS-managed _control-plane_, you should use any AMI provided by AWS specifically for this purpose.
+
The https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-optimized-ami.html[AMIs optimized for Amazon EKS] are built on the Amazon Linux 2 operating system.
+
For deployments on unmanaged AWS, you should use https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/tree/master/images/capi[image builder], an official tool that allows you to create and make images available for _Stratio KEOS_. For more details on image building see the xref:operations-manual:image-builder/aws-image-builder.adoc[guide for AWS].
+
The currently recommended operating system for this provider is Ubuntu 22.04.

* CloudFormation
+
WARNING: Suppose you have not created the CloudFormation stack or manually created the IAM requirements previously in the account. In that case, you must set the `spec:security:aws:create_iam` parameter to true (default is false).

=== Unmanaged GCP

* Permissions
+
For deployments on the Google Cloud Platform, you will require permissions on compute (instances, disks, images, routers, networks, etc.). Similarly to other supported providers, provisioning requires an account with all requested permissions.
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-gcp-permissions.list[Download permissions for GCP].

* Certified operating systems
+
For unmanaged GCP environments use https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/tree/master/images/capi[image builder], an official tool to create and make images available for _Stratio KEOS_. For more details on image building see the xref:operations-manual:image-builder/gcp-image-builder.adoc[guide for GCP].
+
The currently recommended operating system for this provider is Ubuntu 22.04.

=== Azure unmanaged

* Permissions
+
As with other supported providers, provisioning requires an account with all the requested permissions, but in this case in addition a role is required for the cluster _workers_ (indicated in the descriptor in "spec.security.nodes_identity") and another for the _control-plane_ (indicated in the descriptor in "spec.security.control_plane_identity").
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-role.json[Download permissions for Azure].
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-nodes-role.json[Download permissions for Azure _workers_.]
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-cp-role.json[Download permissions for Azure _control-plane_]

* Certified operating systems
+
For environments in Azure it will be possible to use https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/tree/master/images/capi[image builder], an official tool that allows to create and make images available for _Stratio KEOS_. For more details on image building see the xref:operations-manual:image-builder/azure-image-builder.adoc[guide for Azure].
+
The currently recommended operating system for this provider is Ubuntu 22.04, being the one that creates by default the controller of this cloud provider.

=== AKS

* Permissions
+
This type of clusters should be deployed using one identity with the necessary roles for the creation of the resources in Azure as well as for the _workers_ of the cluster (indicated in the descriptor in "spec.security.nodes_identity") and another for the _control-plane_ (indicated in the descriptor in "spec.security.control_plane_identity").
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-aks-role.json[Download permissions for Azure].
** xref:attachment$stratio-aks-nodes-role.json[Download permissions for Azure _workers_]
** xref:attachment$stratio-aks-cp-role.json[Download permissions for Azure _control-plane_]

* Certified operating systems
+
This flavour does not allow to specify any custom image and deploys by default Ubuntu 22.04.

=== Considerations for images

Referring to the _control-plane_, in EKS and AKS you will not be able to indicate an image, but in unmanaged AWS and Azure and in GCP you will be able to.

For both _control-plane_ and _worker_ nodes it is mandatory to indicate images in unmanaged GCP for all versions and in unmanaged AWS for Kubernetes versions ≥ 1.27 in the case of using ECR as registry.

For _worker_ nodes, it is optional on all cloud providers except in the cases described above (when not specified, the controller assigns one made available by the cloud provider).

When creating the image for the cluster, the Operating System needs for the applications that require it (_systemd units, DaemonSets_, etc.) and the version of Kubernetes to be used must be taken into account.

==== Elasticsearch

To support Elasticsearch deployments, the OS must have the `max_map_count = 262144` parameter of the sysctl as indicated by its https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html[official documentation].

For images created with image-builder (*AWS unmanaged, Azure unmanaged and GCP unmanaged*), you have to add the following item in the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/blob/main/images/capi/ansible/roles/node/tasks/main.yml#L55[loop of the kernel parameters] (in _/images/capi/ansible/roles/node/tasks/main.yml_):

[source,yaml]
----
- { param: vm.max_map_count, val: 262144 }
----

Amazon Linux 2 images *used by EKS* already have this parameter/value.

For the *AKS case* and since images cannot be built with image-builder, the following setting is added in the _AzureManagedMachinePool_ object:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  linuxOSConfig:
  sysctls:
    vmMaxMapCount: 262144
----

Therefore, all nodes in the cluster already have this parameter/value.

== Descriptor of the cluster

To indicate the particularities of the cluster, the _KeosCluster_ object is used in a manifest file. The header of this descriptor will be the same as for any Kubernetes object:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: installer.stratio.com/v1beta1

=== Credentials

On the first execution, the credentials for provisioning in the cloud provider will be indicated in this section.

These secrets are encrypted with a passphrase requested from within the provisioning in the _secrets.yml_ file, thus removing the entire credentials section of the descriptor. In subsequent executions, the passphrase is simply requested to decrypt the secrets file, from which the credentials are read.

The following fields are considered provisioning secrets:

[cols="1,4,2,1"]

|Helm repository for the installation of Stratio charts.
|See the <<descriptor_example, Descriptor example>>.
|Yes, for unauthenticated repositories.
|===

NOTE: Any changes to _spec.credentials_ must be made with all credentials in the cluster descriptor and removing the _secrets.yml_ beforehand.

=== Networking

As mentioned above, the installer allows you to use network elements of the cloud provider that you have previously created (e.g. by a network security team), thus enabling architectures that best suit your needs.

Both the VPC and the subnets must be created in the cloud provider. The subnets can be private or public, but if they are public, they must have a _NAT gateway_ and an _Internet Gateway_ in the same VPC. If both types of subnets are specified, the worker nodes will be deployed in private subnets.

_Stratio KEOS_ will not manage the lifecycle of previously created objects.

==== AKS

In this example you can see the following particularities:

* Cluster in Azure with managed _control-plane_ (AKS).
* Kubernetes version 1.24.11 (must be supported by Azure).
* Use of ACR as _Docker registry_ (no credentials needed).
* With AKS tier _Paid_ (recommended for production).
* Group of _worker_ nodes:
** _Standard++_++D8s++_++v3_ type instances in order to support premium volumes.
** With K8s labels.
** With auto-scaling ranges.
** With on-disk customizations.

== Creation of the _cluster_

_Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ is a tool that facilitates the provisioning of the necessary elements in the specified _cloud_ provider for the creation of a Kubernetes _cluster_ according to the specified <<cluster_descriptor, descriptor>>.

Currently, this binary includes the following options:

- `--descriptor`: indicates the path to the cluster descriptor.
- `--vault-password`: specifies the passphrase for credentials encryption.
- `--avoid-creation`: does not create the cluster worker, only the cluster local.
- `--keep-mgmt`: creates the cluster worker but leaves its management in the cluster local (only for *non-productive* environments).
- `--retain`: keeps the cluster local even without management.

To create a _cluster_, a simple command is enough (see the particularities of each provider in their quick start guides):

[source,bash]
-----
sudo ./cloud-provisioner create cluster --name stratio-pre --descriptor cluster-gcp.yaml

The cluster has been installed successfully. Please refer to the documents below on how to proceed:
1. Post-installation Stratio cloud-provisioner documentation
2. Stratio KEOS documentation
-----

Once the process is finished, you will have the necessary files (_keos.yaml_ and _secrets.yml_) to install _Stratio KEOS_.

NOTE: Since the descriptor file for the installation (_keos.yaml_) is regenerated at each execution, a backup of the previous one is performed in the local directory with the corresponding date (e.g. _keos.yaml.2023-07-05@11:19:17~_).

=== Load balancer

Due to a bug in the various _controllers_ (fixed in master branches but not yet released), the load balancer created in the cloud providers of GCP and Azure for the API Server of clusters with unmanaged _control-planes_ is generated with a TCP-based health check.

Eventually, this could generate request problems in case of failure of any of the _control-plane_ nodes, since the load balancer will send requests to _control-plane_ nodes whose port is responsive but cannot handle requests.

To avoid this problem, the health check of the load balancer created must be modified, using the HTTPS protocol and the _/readyz_ path. The port should be maintained, being 443 for GCP and 6443 for Azure.
