= Quick start guide

== AWS unmanaged

=== Prerequisites

* For a user with the required privileges in AWS:
** Create a user for installation.
** Create a policy according to xref:attachment$stratio-aws-unmanaged-policy.json[_stratio-aws-unmanaged-policy.json_].
** Create a policy according to xref:attachment$stratio-aws-temp-policy.json[_stratio-temp-policy.json_] (only for provisioning).
** Attach policies to the user.
** Create an access key.
* Private and public DNS zones created in AWS (optional).
* Customized infrastructure created in AWS (optional).
* Compose the cluster descriptor file.
** User credentials (_access++_++key_ and _secret++_++key_) and account data (region and _account++_++id_), which will be encrypted on first run.
** GitHub token for downloading templates (optional).
** Account data (region and _account++_++id_).
** Data of the infrastructure already created (optional).
** Management of DNS zones created (optional).
** ECR URL.
** External domain of the cluster.
** _control-plane_.
** Node groups.
** Information required for the _Stratio KEOS_ installation.

NOTE: For Kubernetes versions higher than 1.26, the installation requires a custom image with necessary parameters for Elasticsearch and the ECR plugin for the _kubelet_.

NOTE: In case the _cloudformation_ stack has not been previously created in the account, the `spec:security:aws:create_iam` parameter must be set to "true". Otherwise, to "false".

==== _control-plane_ nodes

For this provider, the _control-plane_ will be deployed in VMs, therefore, the following options can be configured:

* _highly++_++available_: defines whether the _control-plane_ will have high availability (default: _true_).
* _managed_: indicates that it is a _control-plane_ in VMs.
* _size_: instance type.
* _node++_++image_: image of the nodes of the _control-plane_ (optional). The indicated image must exist in the account.
* _root++_++volume_: disk particulars (optional).
** _size_: size in GB (default: 30GB).
** _type_: disk type (default: gp3).
** _encrypted_: disk encryption (default: _false_).

==== _worker_ nodes

In the cluster descriptor, groups of _worker_ nodes can be indicated with the following options:

* _name_: group name, cannot be repeated.
* _size_: instance type.
* _quantity_: number of _workers_ in the group.
* _min++_++size_: minimum number of nodes for autoscaling (optional).
* _max++_++size_: maximum number of nodes for autoscaling (optional).
* _labels_: node labels in Kubernetes (optional).
* _root++_++volume_: disk specifics (optional).

* _node++_++image_: image of the _worker_ nodes (optional). The indicated image must exist and be compatible with the Kubernetes version.
* _zone++_++distribution_: indicates whether the number of nodes should be balanced in the zones or not (default: _balanced_).
* _az_: zone of the _workers_ group (optional). If specified, only this one will be used for the whole group. This parameter overrides what is specified in _zone++_++distribution_.

NOTE: By default, the distribution of nodes will be done in zones a, b and c of the indicated region in a balanced way, therefore, the rest of the division by three of the quantity of nodes will be discarded. Example: if "quantity=7" is specified, only 2 nodes will be deployed in each of the zones.

==== _keos-installer_

In order to facilitate the installation of _Stratio KEOS_, in the provisioning process a functional _keos.yaml_ file is generated and ready to launch the installation. For this purpose, the version and flavour (_production_, _development_ or _minimal_) can be indicated in the cluster descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
  keos:
    version: 1.0.2
    flavour: development
----

For any extra customization, the file must be modified before running the _keos-installer_.

==== Considerations

* In case of using custom infrastructure, the VPC and 3 subnets, one per region zone (a, b and c) must be specified.
* The version of Kubernetes configured must be the one supported in the images indicated (optional).
* The _worker++_++nodes_ group names cannot be repeated.

TIP: For more details, see the xref:ROOT:installation.adoc[installation guide].

=== Installation

NOTE: By default, the distribution of nodes will be done in zones a, b and c of the indicated region in a balanced way, therefore, the rest of the division by three of the number of nodes will be discarded. Example: if 'quantity=7' is specified, only 2 nodes will be deployed in each of the zones.

==== _keos-installer_

In order to facilitate the installation of _Stratio KEOS_, in the provisioning process a functional _keos.yaml_ file is generated and ready to launch the installation. For this purpose, the version and flavour (_production_, _development_ or _minimal_) can be indicated in the cluster descriptor.

[source,yaml]
----
  keos:
    version: 1.0.2
    flavour: development
----

For any extra customization, the file must be modified before running the _keos-installer_.

==== Considerations

* If you use custom infrastructure, you must indicate the VPC and 3 subnets, one per region zone (a, b and c).
* The Kubernetes version indicated must be supported by AKS.
* The names of the _worker++_++nodes_ groups cannot be repeated.
