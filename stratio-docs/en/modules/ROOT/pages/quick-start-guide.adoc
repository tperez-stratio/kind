= Quick start guide

== EKS

=== Prerequisites

* For a user with the required privileges in AWS:
** Create a user for installation.
** Create policy according to xref:attachment$stratio-eks-policy.json[_stratio-eks-policy.json_].
** Create policy according to xref:attachment$stratio-eks-temp-policy.json[_stratio-eks-temp-policy.json_] (for provisioning only).
** Attach policies to the user.
** Create an access key.
* Private and public hosted zones created in AWS (optional).
* Custom infrastructure created on AWS (optional).
* Compose the cluster descriptor file.
** User credentials (_access$$_$$key_ and _secret$$_$$key_) and account data (region and _account$$_$$id_), which will be encrypted on first run.
** GitHub token for downloading templates.
** Account data (region and _account$$_$$id_).
** Data of the infrastructure already created (optional).
** DNS zones of the created hosted zones (optional).
** ECR URL.
** Enable logging in EKS per component (optional).
** Node groups.
** Information required for the installation of _Stratio KEOS_.

Regarding the _control-plane_, in the cluster descriptor you can indicate that it is a *_managed_control-plane_* and the logs that you want to activate (_APIserver_, _audit_, _authenticator_, _controller$$_$$manager_ and/or _scheduler_).

Likewise, *groups of worker nodes* can be indicated with the following options:

* _name_: group name, cannot be repeated.
* _size_: instance type.
* _quantity_: number of _workers_ in the group.
* _min$$_$$size_: minimum number of nodes for autoscaling (optional).
* _max$$_$$size_: maximum number of nodes for autoscaling (optional).
* _labels_: node labels in Kubernetes (optional).
* _root$$_$$volume_: disk specifics (optional).
** _size_: size in GB (default: 30GB).
** _type_: disk type (default: gp2).
** _encrypted_: disk encryption (default: _false_).
* _ssh$$_$$key_: SSH key for node access (optional). Must exist in the provider.
* _spot_: indicates if the instance is of spot type (optional).
* _node$$_$$image_: the image of the worker nodes (optional). The indicated image must exist and be compatible with EKS.
* _zone$$_$$distribution_: indicates whether the number of nodes must be balanced in the zones or not (default: _balanced_).
* _az_: zone of the worker's group (optional). If specified, only this one will be used for the whole group. This parameter overrides what is specified in _zone$$_$$distribution_.

NOTE: By default, the distribution of nodes will be done in zones a, b and c of the indicated region in a balanced way, therefore, the rest of the division by three of the number of nodes will be discarded. Example: if 'quantity=7' is specified, only 2 nodes will be deployed in each of the zones.

==== _keos-installer_

In order to facilitate the installation of _Stratio KEOS_, in the provisioning process a functional _keos.yaml_ file is generated and ready to launch the installation. For this purpose, the version and flavor (_production_, _development_ or _minimal_) can be indicated in the cluster descriptor.

[source,bash]
----
  keos:
    version: 0.8.1
    flavour: development
----

For any extra customization, the file must be modified before running the _keos-installer_.

==== Considerations

* If you use custom infrastructure, you must indicate the VPC and 3 subnets, one per region zone (a, b and c).
* The Kubernetes version indicated must be supported by EKS.
* The _worker$$_$$nodes_ group names cannot be repeated.

TIP: For more details, see the xref:ROOT:installation.adoc[installation guide].

=== Installation

You should run the provisioning and installation of the Kubernetes phase, from a Linux machine with internet access and a Docker installed.

Once you have downloaded the `.tgz` file of the _cloud-provisioner_, proceed to unzip it and run it with the creation parameters:

[source,bash]
----
$ tar xvzf cloud-provisioner-*tar.gz
$ sudo ./bin/cloud-provisioner create cluster --name <cluster_id> --descriptor cluster.yaml

----

=== Next steps

At this point, you will have a Kubernetes cluster with the features indicated in the descriptor and you will be able to access the EKS API Server with the AWS CLI as indicated in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-kubeconfig.html[the official documentation].

[source,bash]
----
$ aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <cluster_id> --kubeconfig ./<cluster_id>.kubeconfig

$ kubectl --kubeconfig ./<cluster_id>.kubeconfig get nodes
----

Here, the permissions of _clusterawsadm.json_ can be removed.

Next, proceed to deploy _Stratio KEOS_ *using _keos-installer_*.

== GCP

=== Prerequisites

* Create an _IAM Service Account_ with the permissions defined in xref:attachment$stratio-gcp-permissions.list[stratio-gcp-permissions.list].
* Create a private key for the _IAM Service Account_ of type JSON and download it in a `<project_name>-<id>.json` file. This data will be used for the credentials requested in the cluster descriptor.
* Deploy a "Cloud NAT" in the region (requires a "Cloud Router", but can be created in the wizard itself).
* Private and public zones in Cloud DNS created in GCP (optional).
* Custom infrastructure created in GCP (optional).
* Compose the cluster descriptor file.
** User credentials (_private$$_$$key$$_$$id_, _private$$_$$key_ and _client$$_$$email_) and account data (region and _project$$_$$id_), which will be encrypted on first run.
** GitHub token for template download.
** Data of the already created infrastructure (optional).
** DNS zone of the created zones (optional).
** Docker registry data (URL, credentials).
** External domain of the cluster.
** _control-plane_.
** Node groups.
** Information necessary for the installation of _Stratio KEOS_.

==== _control-plane_ nodes

For this provider, the _control-plane_ will be deployed in virtual machines, therefore, the following options can be configured:

* _highly$$_$$available_: defines whether the _control-plane_ will have high availability (default: _true_).
* _managed_: indicates that it is a _control-plane_ in virtual machines.
* _size_: instance type.
* _node$$_$$image_: image of the nodes of the _control-plane_. The indicated image must exist in the referenced project.
* _root$$_$$volume_: disk particularities (optional).
** _size_: size in GB (default: 30GB).
** _type_: disk type (default: gp2).
** _encrypted_: disk encryption (default: _false_).

==== Worker nodes

In the cluster descriptor, groups of worker nodes can be indicated with the following options:

* _name_: group name, cannot be repeated. It must start with "<cluster$$_$$name$$_$$>-".
* _size_: instance type.
* _quantity_: number of workers in the group.
* _min$$_$$size_: minimum number of nodes for autoscaling (optional).
* _max$$_$$size_: maximum number of nodes for autoscaling (optional).
* _labels_: node labels in Kubernetes (optional).
* _root$$_$$volume_: disk specifics (optional).
** _size_: size in GB (default: 30GB).
** _type_: disk type (default: gp2).
** _encrypted_: disk encryption (default: _false_).
* _ssh$$_$$key_: SSH key for node access (optional). Must exist in the provider.
* _spot_: indicates if the instance is of type _spot_ (optional).
* _node$$_$$image_: the image of the worker nodes. The indicated image must exist and be compatible with EKS.
* _zone$$_$$distribution_: indicates whether the number of nodes must be balanced in the zones or not (default: _balanced_).
* _az_: zone of the worker's group (optional). If specified, only this one will be used for the whole group. This parameter overrides what is specified in _zone$$_$$distribution_.

NOTE: By default, the distribution of nodes will be done in zones a, b and c of the indicated region in a balanced way, therefore, the rest of the division by three of the number of nodes will be discarded. Example: if 'quantity=7' is specified, only 2 nodes will be deployed in each of the zones.

==== _keos-installer_

In order to facilitate the installation of _Stratio KEOS_, in the provisioning process a functional _keos.yaml_ file is generated and ready to launch the installation. For this purpose, the version and flavor ('production', 'development' or 'minimal') can be indicated in the cluster descriptor.

[source,bash]
----
  keos:
    version: 0.8.1
    flavour: development
----

For any extra customization, the file must be modified before running the _keos-installer_.

=== Considerations

* If you use custom infrastructure, you must indicate the VPC and 3 subnets, one per region zone (a, b and c).
* The configured Kubernetes version must be the one supported in the indicated images.
* _worker$$_$$nodes_ cluster names cannot be repeated and must start with "<cluster$$_$$name$$_$$>-".
