== Introduction

image::arq-intro.png[]

The _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ is the initial phase for the creation of a _Stratio KEOS_ cluster in a cloud provider. This comprises the provisioning of the infrastructure (virtual machines, private network, load balancers, etc., in the cloud), the creation of a Kubernetes cluster, its networking and storage.

To carry out the creation of the cluster, _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ will create a Kubernetes _KeosCluster_ resource and the controller in charge of its lifecycle, _Stratio Cluster Operator_. This _KeosCluster_ will be in charge of generating the necessary resources for the creation and operation of the cluster.

At the end of the creation of the cluster in this phase and according to an indicated cluster descriptor, a descriptor file (_keos.yaml_) and another encrypted credentials file (_secrets.yml_) will be created for the next phase, _Stratio KEOS_ installation.

Once the installation is complete, all day 2 operations on the cloud infrastructure itself on which the various services are running must be performed by editing _KeosCluster_ to manage the cluster resources. These edits will be validated and applied by the _Stratio Cluster Operator_.

== _KeosCluster_ object

During the installation phase, after deploying the _Stratio Cluster Operator_ Helm chart and taking the cluster descriptor as a starting point, a _KeosCluster_ resource will be created by default, which will centralize the creation of the cluster and all the objects of the different cloud providers and the operations on these.

=== Mitigation of human error

By centralizing all operations on the cluster and the various cloud resources, once an operation triggered by an edit of the _KeosCluster_ object is started the _Stratio Cluster Operator_ driver will deny any further requests until the previous operation has been completed.

For this purpose, the _KeosCluster_ subresource is defined being a status that will report the type of operation it is doing in case it is.

== Cloud provider objects

In a *default deployment*, the following objects are created in each cloud provider (in [silver]#gray# optional objects that will depend on what is specified in the cluster descriptor):

=== EKS

* 1 Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with add-ons for EBS and CNI, logging (if specified) and an OIDC provider.
** 2 EKS Security Groups for the _control-plane_ and the _Worker_ nodes.
** 1 IAM role with AmazonEKSClusterPolicy policy.
* [silver]#1 VPC.#
* [silver]#6 subnets with their respective routing tables.#
** [silver]#3 public subnets (one per AZ).#
** [silver]#3 private subnets (also one per AZ).#
* [silver]#1 NAT gateway for each public subnet.#
* [silver]#1 Internet gateway for the VPC.#
* [silver]#1 default route in the routing table of each public subnet to exit to the Internet through the NAT gateways.#
* [silver]#1 default route in the routing table of each public subnet to exit to the Internet through the Internet Gateway.#
* 1 IAM policy for the cluster nodes (_nodes.cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io_).
* 1 IAM role for cluster nodes (_nodes.cluster-api-provider-aws.sigs.k8s.io_).
* VMs for _workers_ (according to cluster descriptor and auto-scaling).
** 1 EBS volume for each persistent volume.
* 1 network type load balancer for the exposure of load balancer type _Services_.
** 1 listener per port for each service.

== Networking

Reference architecture

The internal networking layer of the cluster is based on Calico, with the following integrations per provider/flavour:

=== Proprietary infrastructure

Although one of the advantages of automatic resource creation in provisioning is the great dynamism it provides, for security and compliance reasons, it is often necessary to create certain resources prior to the deployment of _Stratio KEOS_ in the cloud provider.

In this sense, the _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ allows using both a VPC and subnets previously created using the networks parameter in the cluster descriptor, as detailed in the xref:ROOT:installation.adoc[installation guide].

Example for EKS:

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  networks:
    vpc_id: vpc-02698....
    subnets:
      - subnet_id: subnet-0416d...
      - subnet_id: subnet-0b2f8...
      - subnet_id: subnet-0df75...
----

=== Pods network

In most providers/flavours it is allowed to specify a specific CIDR for pods, with certain particularities described below.

NOTE: The CIDR for pods must not overlap with the nodes' network or any other target network that the nodes need to access.

==== EKS

In this case, and since the AWS VPC CNI is used as IPAM, only one of the two ranges supported by EKS will be allowed: 100.64.0.0.0/16 or 198.19.0.0.0/16 (always taking into account the restrictions of the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-cidr-blocks.html#add-cidr-block-restrictions[official documentation]), which will be added to the VPC as secondary CIDR.

NOTE: If no custom infrastructure is indicated, the CIDR 100.64.0.0.0/16 should be used.

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  networks:
	  pods_cidr: 100.64.0.0/16
----

In this case, 3 subnets will be created (1 per zone) with an 18-bit mask (/18) of the indicated range from which the IPs for the pods will be obtained:

[.center,cols="1,2",width=40%]
|===
^|zone-a
^|100.64.0.0/18

^||zone-b
^|100.64.64.0/18

^||zone-c
^|100.64.128.0/18
|===

In case of using custom infrastructure, the 3 subnets (one per zone) for the pods must be indicated together with those of the nodes in the cluster descriptor:

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  networks:
      vpc_id: vpc-0264503b4f41ff69f # example-custom-vpc
      pods_subnets:
          - subnet_id: subnet-0f6aa193eaa31015e # example-custom-sn-pods-zone-a
          - subnet_id: subnet-0ad0a80d1cec762d7 # example-custom-sn-pods-zone-b
          - subnet_id: subnet-0921f337cb6a6128d # example-custom-sn-pods-zone-c
      subnets:
          - subnet_id: subnet-0416da6767f910929 # example-custom-sn-priv-zone-a
          - subnet_id: subnet-0b2f81b89da1dfdfd # example-custom-sn-priv-zone-b
          - subnet_id: subnet-0df75719efe5f6615 # example-custom-sn-priv-zone-c
      pods_cidr: 100.64.0.0.0/16
----

NOTE: The secondary CIDR assigned to the VPC for the pods must be indicated in the `spec.networks.pods_cidr` parameter.

The CIDR of each subnet (obtained from the secondary CIDR of the VPC), must be the same as described above (with 18-bit mask), and the 3 subnets for pods must have the following tag: _sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-aws/association=secondary_.

== Security

=== Authentication

Currently, for communication with cloud providers, the controllers store in the cluster the credentials of the identity used in the installation.

These credentials can be viewed with the following commands:

=== IMDS access (for EKS)

Since pods can impersonate the node where they run by simply interacting with IMDS, a global network policy (Calico's _GlobalNetworkPolicy_) is used to prevent access to all pods in the cluster that are not part of _Stratio KEOS_.

In turn, the EKS OIDC provider is enabled to allow the use of IAM roles for _Service Accounts_, ensuring the use of the IAM policies with minimal privileges.

=== Access to the API Server endpoint

==== EKS

During the creation of the EKS cluster, an endpoint is created for the API Server to be used for access the cluster from the installer and lifecycle operations.

This endpoint is published to the internet, and its access is restricted with a combination of Amazon's Identity and Access Management (IAM) rules, and Kubernetes' native Role Based Access Control (RBAC).

== Storage

=== Nodes (_control-plane_ and _workers_)

Regarding storage, a single root disk is mounted and its type, size and encryption can be defined (you can specify a previously created encryption key).

Example:

[source,bash]
----
type: gp3
size: 384Gi
encrypted: true
encryption_key: <key_name>
----

These disks are created in the initial provisioning of the _worker_ nodes, so this data is passed as descriptor parameters.

=== _StorageClass_

By default, a _StorageClass_ with name "keos" is made available for block disk during provisioning. This _StorageClass_ is created with the parameters `reclaimPolicy: Delete` and `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer`, i.e. the disk will be created at the moment a pod consumes the corresponding _PersistentVolumeClaim_ and will be deleted when the _PersistentVolume_ is deleted.

NOTE: Note that _PersistentVolumes_ created from this _StorageClass_ will have affinity to the area where they have been consumed.

From the cluster descriptor it is possible to indicate the encryption key, the class of disks or free parameters.

*Example with basic options:*

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  infra_provider: aws
  storageclass:
    encryption_key: <my_simm_key>
    class: premium
----

The `class` parameter can be _premium_ or _standard_, this will depend on the cloud provider:

[.center,cols=“1,2,2”,width=70%,center]
|===
^|Provider ^|Standard class ^|Premium class

^|AWS
^|gp3
^|io2 (64k IOPS)
|===

*Example with free parameters:*

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  infra_provider: aws
  storageclass:
    parameters:
      type: pd-extreme
      provisioned-iops-on-create: 5000
      disk-encryption-kms-key: <nombre_clave>
      tags: "key1=value1,key2=value2"
----

The latter also depend on the cloud provider:

[.center,cols="1,2",width=80%]
|===
^|Provider ^|Parameter

^|All
a| [source,bash]
----
     fsType
----

^|AWS
a| [source,bash]
----
     type
     labels
     iopsPerGB
     kmsKeyId
     allowAutoIOPSPerGBIncrease
     iops
     throughput
     encrypted
     blockExpress
     blockSize
----

|===

Other non-default _StorageClasses_ are created in provisioning depending on the provider, but to use them workloads will need to specify them in their deployment.

=== Amazon EFS

In this release, if you want to use an EFS file system you must first create and pass the following data to the cluster descriptor:

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  storageclass:
      efs:
          name: fs-015ea5e2ba5fe7fa5
          id: fs-015ea5e2ba5fe7fa5
          permissions: 700
----

With this data, the _keos.yaml_ will be rendered so that in the execution of the _keos-installer_ the driver is displayed and the corresponding _StorageClass_ is configured.

NOTE: This functionality is intended for customized infrastructure, since the EFS file system must be associated to an existing VPC in its creation.

== Tags in EKS

All objects created in EKS contain by default the tag with key _keos.stratio.com/owner_ and as value the name of the cluster. It is also allowed to add custom tags to all objects created in the cloud provider as follows:

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  control_plane:
    tags:
      - tier: production
      - billing-area: data
----

To add attributes to the volumes created by the _StorageClass_, use the `labels` parameter in the corresponding section:

[source,bash]
----
spec:
  storageclass:
    parameters:
      labels: "tier=production,billing-area=data"
      ..
----

== Docker registries

As a prerequisite to the installation of _Stratio KEOS_, the Docker images of all its components must reside in a Docker registry which will be indicated in the cluster descriptor (`keos_registry: true`). There should be one (and only one) Docker registry for _Stratio KEOS_, the rest will be configured on the nodes to be able to use their images in any deployment.

Currently, 3 types of Docker registries are supported: _generic_, _ecr_ and _acr_. For the _generic_ type, you must indicate if the registry is authenticated or not (_ecr_ and _acr_ types cannot have authentication), and if it is, it is mandatory to indicate user and password in the 'spec.credentials' section.

The following table shows the supported registries by provider/flavour:
