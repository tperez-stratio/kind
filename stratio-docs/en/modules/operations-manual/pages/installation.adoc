= Installation

== Prerequisites

=== EKS

* Roles and policies
+
For automated provisioning in EKS, it is necessary to execute actions on various services such as EC2, ECR, EKS, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), etc. Although the use of these actions may vary according to the type of installation, the provider verifies that the indicated user has the required permissions to guarantee correct operation.
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-eks-policy.json[Download permanent permissions for EKS].
** xref:attachment$stratio-aws-temp-policy.json[Download temporary permissions for EKS].
+
For EKS deployment, you must manually create the AWSServiceRoleForAmazonEKS role and associate to it the AmazonEKSServiceRolePolicy policy (created by default in AWS).

* Certified operating systems
+
To ensure the functionality of the EKS managed _control-plane_, it is necessary to use the images provided by Stratio. These can be found in the xref:stratio-generative-ai-data-fabric:ROOT:stratio-generative-ai-data-fabric-artifacts.adoc#_images_for_cloud_environments[__Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric__ artifacts] section of the documentation.
+
The currently recommended operating system for this provider is Ubuntu 22.04.

* CloudFormation
+
WARNING: Suppose you have not created the CloudFormation stack or manually created the IAM requirements previously in the account. In that case, you must set the `spec.security.aws.create_iam` parameter to _true_ (default is _false_).

=== GKE

* Permissions
+
In GKE, the service account under which _clusters_ are provisioned must have the following permissions.
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-gcp-permissions.list[Download permissions for GCP].
** xref:attachment$stratio-gke-permissions.list[Download permissions for GKE].

* Certified operating systems
+
For GKE, the default operating system is Container-Optimized OS (COS), and no specific image needs to be specified.
+
* Enable “Google Kubernetes Engine API" for GKE.
* Bastion.
+
The deployment of _Stratio KEOS_ in GKE must be done using a bastion that facilitates communication with the cluster. For this, it is necessary to create a bastion on the same network as the cluster.

=== Azure unmanaged

* Permissions
+
To provision in unmanaged Azure, you need an account with all the required permissions, just like with other supported providers. Additionally, you must define:
+
** A role for the cluster _workers_ in `spec.security.nodes_identity`.
** A role for the _control-plane_ in `spec.security.control_plane_identity`.
+
For subscription-level permissions, the following are recommended:
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-role.json[Download permissions for the Azure deployment user].
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-nodes-role.json[Download permissions for Azure _workers_].
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-cp-role.json[Download permissions for the Azure _control-plane_].
+
For resource group-level permissions, the following are recommended:
+
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-role-rg.json[Download permissions for the Azure deployment user].
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-nodes-role-rg.json[Download permissions for Azure _workers_].
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-cp-role-rg.json[Download permissions for the Azure _control-plane_].
** xref:attachment$stratio-azure-acr.json[Download permissions for the Azure deployment user, _workers_, and _control-plane_].
** Additionally, the following permissions must be assigned at the resource group level:
*** Deployment user: `Acrpull` for `/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<acr_name>`
*** _Control-plane_: `Acrpull` for `/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<acr_name>`
*** _Workers_: `Acrpull` for `/subscriptions/<subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<acr_name>`
+
* Certified operating systems
+
In Azure environments, you must use the images provided by Stratio. Refer to the xref:stratio-generative-ai-data-fabric:ROOT:stratio-generative-ai-data-fabric-artifacts.adoc#_images_for_cloud_environments[__Stratio Generative AI Data Fabric__ artifacts] section.
+
The recommended operating system is Ubuntu 22.04, which is the default configuration for the Azure _controller_.

=== Considerations for images

Referring to the _control-plane_, in EKS and GKE you will not be able to indicate an image, but Azure unmanaged will.

In unmanaged Azure, it is optional to indicate the image for _worker_ nodes (by not indicating it, the _controller_ assigns one made available by the cloud provider).

When creating the image for the cluster, the Operating System needs for the applications that require it (_systemd units, DaemonSets_, etc.) and the version of Kubernetes to be used must be taken into account.

==== Elasticsearch

To support Elasticsearch deployments, the OS must have the `max_map_count = 262144` parameter of the sysctl as indicated by its https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html[official documentation].

Amazon Linux 2 images *used by EKS* already have this parameter/value.

== Descriptor of the cluster

To indicate the particularities of the cluster, the _KeosCluster_ object is used in a manifest file. The header of this descriptor will be the same as for any Kubernetes object:

[source,yaml]

=== Credentials

On the first execution, the credentials for provisioning in the cloud provider will be indicated in this section.

These secrets are encrypted with a passphrase requested during provisioning and stored in the _secrets.yml_ file, removing the entire credentials section from the descriptor. In subsequent executions, the passphrase is simply requested to decrypt the secrets file, from which the credentials are read.

The following fields are considered provisioning secrets:

[cols="1,4,2,1"]
|===
^|Name ^|Description ^|Example ^|Optional

|_aws_
|Credentials for AWS access.
|See the <<descriptor_example, descriptor example>>.

|===

NOTE: Any changes to _spec.credentials_ must be made with all credentials in the cluster descriptor and removing the _secrets.yml_ beforehand.

=== Helm repository

As an installation prerequisite, the Helm repository from which the _Cluster Operator_ chart can be extracted must be specified. This section allows you to specify the URL of the repository, its type and whether it is an authenticated repository.

[cols="1,4,2,1"]
|===
^|Name ^|Description ^|Example ^|Optional

| _auth++_++required_
| Indicates if the repository is authenticated.
| false
| Yes. Default: false.

| Yes. Default: generic.
|===

NOTE: OCI repositories (from _cloud_ providers such as ECR, GAR or ACR) are never authenticated. Authentication will be done by the credentials used in provisioning. Please check the _Stratio KEOS_ documentation for the repositories supported in the version to be used.

=== Networking

As mentioned above, the installer allows you to use network elements of the cloud provider that you have previously created (e.g. by a network security team), thus enabling architectures that best suit your needs.

Both the VPC and the subnets must be created in the cloud provider. The subnets can be private or public, but if they are public, they must have a _NAT gateway_ and an _Internet Gateway_ in the same VPC. If both types of subnets are specified, the worker nodes will be deployed in private subnets.

_Stratio KEOS_ will not manage the lifecycle of previously created objects.

[cols="1,4,2,1"]
|===
^|Name ^|Description ^|Example ^|Optional

|_vpc++_++id_
|VPC ID.
|vpc-0264503b8761ff69f

== Creation of the cluster

_Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ is a tool that facilitates the provisioning of the necessary elements in the specified cloud provider for the creation of a Kubernetes cluster according to the specified <<cluster_descriptor, descriptor>>.

Currently, this binary includes the following options:

- `--descriptor`: indicates the path to the cluster descriptor.
- `--vault-password`: specifies the passphrase for credentials encryption.
- `--avoid-creation`: does not create the cluster worker, only the cluster local.
- `--keep-mgmt`: creates the cluster worker but leaves its management in the cluster local (only for *non-productive* environments).
- `--retain`: keeps the cluster local even without management.
- `--use-local-stratio-image`: do not build the _stratio-capi-image_ and use the local image.

To create a cluster, a simple command is enough (see the particularities of each provider in their quick start guides):

[source,bash]
-----
sudo ./cloud-provisioner create cluster --name stratio-pre --descriptor cluster-gcp.yaml

The cluster has been installed successfully. Please refer to the documents below on how to proceed:
1. Post-installation _Stratio Cloud Provisioner_ documentation.
2. _Stratio KEOS_ documentation.
-----

Once the process is finished, you will have the necessary files (_keos.yaml_ and _secrets.yml_) to install _Stratio KEOS_.

NOTE: Since the descriptor file for the installation (_keos.yaml_) is regenerated at each execution, a backup of the previous one is performed in the local directory with the corresponding date (e.g. _keos.yaml.2023-07-05@11:19:17~_).

=== Load balancer

Due to a bug in the various _controllers_ (fixed in master branches but not yet released), the load balancer created in the cloud providers of GCP and Azure for the API Server of clusters with unmanaged _control-planes_ is generated with a TCP-based health check.

Eventually, this could generate request problems in case of failure of any of the _control-plane_ nodes, since the load balancer will send requests to _control-plane_ nodes whose port is responsive but cannot handle requests.

To avoid this problem, the health check of the load balancer created must be modified, using the HTTPS protocol and the _/readyz_ path. The port should be maintained, being 443 for GCP and 6443 for Azure.

== Deployment of _aws-load-balancer-controller_ (EKS only)

In EKS clusters, it is possible to deploy a controller (_aws-load-balancer-controller_) responsible for creating _Elastic Load Balancers_, used by objects such as _Ingress_ and _Service_ type _LoadBalancer_.

Since this deployment is not enabled by default, it must be indicated with _spec.eks_lb_controller_: true in the _ClusterConfig_ object of the cluster descriptor.

To authorize the controller, we will use https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[IAM roles for service accounts], which involves creating the corresponding IAM objects as indicated below:

* Define the following environment variables:
+
[source,shell]
----
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<account_id>
export AWS_REGION=<aws_region>
export AWS_VPC_ID=<vpc_id>
export AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=<aws_eks_cluster_name>
export AWS_EKS_OIDC_ID=$(aws eks describe-cluster --region ${AWS_REGION} --name ${AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME} --query 'cluster.identity.oidc.issuer' --output text | awk -F'/' '{print $NF}')
export AWS_IAM_POLICY_NAME="${AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}-lb-controller-manager"
export AWS_IAM_ROLE_NAME="${AWS_EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}-lb-controller-manager"
