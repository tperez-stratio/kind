# AZURE (AKS) Permissions

Requirements:
- Service Principal (cloud-provisioner credentials)
  - Application Id = descriptor (client_id)
  - AAD - Application Secret ID = descriptor (client_secret)
- Resource group (capz for example) (control-plane and workers identities)
  - Managed Identity (capz-test-agp-restricted) --> Azure roles Assignments (aks-capz-test-role-node)
  - Managed Identity (capz-test-controlplane) --> Azure roles Assignments (aks-capz-test-role-control-plane)
